### Week 1: Project Foundation & Arrays Foundations
**Objective:** Establish a robust Next.js project structure and a unified design system.

**Objective 2:** Complete the initial arrays page with major features completed.
- **Technical Implementation:**
    - Refactor and organize the existing codebase (routing, file structure, etc.).
    - Fully set up Next.js dynamic routing and Tailwind CSS for responsive, consistent styling.
    - Create reusable components to be used for the arrays algorithms
- **Learning Components:**
    - Familiarize with Next.js fundamentals and Tailwind CSS patterns.
    - Get used to using D3.js. 
- **Outcome:** A clean, scalable foundation that supports smooth feature integration in subsequent sprints.

### Week 2: Arrays implementation
**Objective:** Start implementation of all other arrays algorithms
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Creation of the other pages, specifically the following other algorithms.
    - Merge Sort (this may be more complicated with merging visualization)
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Binary Search
    - Linear Search
